Guideline for the Program Execution:

program name: pretty_print

--For data: two text file has been provided word and word1.
for other data set, user need to store the paragraph of his choice
as text files
--User need to store these files where the program has been stored
--user need to provide 2 input at command line argumen:
  1: the width limit for paragraph lines as 1st argument (integer value)
  2: text file name in which he stored the paragraph as 2nd argument.(with .txt extension)
  the two files can be used as sample i/p: word and word1.

NOTE: the program only ingnores few general special characters at the end of any 
 words and not from the begining or middle.
