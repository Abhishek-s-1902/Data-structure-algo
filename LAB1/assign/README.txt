Guideline for the Program Execution:

User need to provide the range value (in our case its 1000, 10000, 50000, 100000) at argument line
And each sorting program will generate the data of that range from the java class file Dataset.java
For each of 4 data types (Random values, Sorted, 1/4th sorted, Poisson values). 

1. compile each file with command javac <FileName>.java 
2. Execute with command java <FileName> <Range>


File name:

DataSet.java
MergeSort.java
MY_CHOICE_QSORT.java
QuickSort.java
HeapSort.java
